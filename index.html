        <h2>Burgers for <span style="font-family: monospace;">HACKERS</span></h2>
        <p><em>All burgers come with a choice of brioche or whole wheat bun. Buns can be toasted.</em></p>

        <h3>Normal Burger</h3>
        <p>Beef patty, choice of the usual toppings, cheddar or American.</p>

        <h3>Double Burger</h3>
        <p>A normal burger, <em>BUT TWICE AS MUCH SO!!1!</em></p>

        <h3>Halal Cart Burger</h3>
        <p>Beef & Lamb Gyro patty with lettuce, tomato, and mysterious halal cart veggies. White sauce & hot sauce non-negotiable, cheese optional.</p>

        <h3>Abomination Big Mac</h3>
        <p>Burger in the front, lamb gyro in the back! Imagine a Big Mac, but the middle bun is pita and one of the patties is just stuff from the cart down the street. We're going to start a revolution.</p>

        <h3>MORE THAN ONE<br>Burger??!?!!??!</h3>
        <p>If your only crime was curiosity, who am I to stop you.</p>
